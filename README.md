## Entities and Attributes

Each entity represents a distinct object or concept within the e-commerce system. Attributes define the properties or characteristics of these entities.

### 1. Product

**Description:** Represents items available for sale on the platform.

**Attributes:**

- `ProductID` (**PK**): Unique identifier for each product.
- `Name`: The name of the product.
- `Description`: Detailed information about the product.
- `Price`: The selling price of the product.
- `StockQuantity`: Current stock level of the product.
- `ReorderThreshold`: Stock level at which the product should be reordered.
- `CategoryID` (**FK**): References the primary category of the product.
- `SubcategoryID` (**FK**, nullable): References the subcategory, if applicable.
- `CreatedAt`: Timestamp when the product was added.
- `UpdatedAt`: Timestamp of the last update to the product details.

**Rationale:** The `ReorderThreshold` facilitates automated inventory management. `CategoryID` and `SubcategoryID` allow hierarchical categorization, enhancing product organization and searchability.

### 2. Category

**Description:** Defines classifications for products, enabling organized browsing and management.

**Attributes:**

- `CategoryID` (**PK**): Unique identifier for each category.
- `Name`: The name of the category.
- `Description`: Detailed information about the category.
- `ParentCategoryID` (**FK**, nullable): References a parent category for hierarchical structuring.
- `CreatedAt`: Timestamp when the category was created.
- `UpdatedAt`: Timestamp of the last update to the category.

**Rationale:** Self-referencing `ParentCategoryID` allows for multi-level category hierarchies, supporting complex product classifications.

### 3. Customer

**Description:** Represents users registered on the platform who can make purchases.

**Attributes:**

- `CustomerID` (**PK**): Unique identifier for each customer.
- `FirstName`: Customer's first name.
- `LastName`: Customer's last name.
- `Email` (**Unique**): Customer's email address, used for login and communication.
- `PasswordHash`: Encrypted password for authentication.
- `PhoneNumber`: Customer's contact number.
- `CreatedAt`: Timestamp when the customer registered.
- `UpdatedAt`: Timestamp of the last update to customer details.

**Rationale:** Storing `PasswordHash` ensures security by not keeping plaintext passwords. `Email` serves as a unique identifier for account management and communication.

### 4. Address

**Description:** Stores shipping and billing addresses associated with customers.

**Attributes:**

- `AddressID` (**PK**): Unique identifier for each address.
- `CustomerID` (**FK**): References the customer owning the address.
- `Street`: Street address.
- `City`: City of the address.
- `State`: State or province.
- `PostalCode`: ZIP or postal code.
- `Country`: Country of the address.
- `IsPrimary`: Boolean indicating if it's the primary address.
